  - "Oh my\u2026 that\u2019s fascinating! How did you do that?"
  - "That, my curious friend, is no ordinary lantern. It\u2019s a relic of another
    age, capable of revealing\u2026 let\u2019s call them hidden truths. What you\u2019re
    seeing is a fragment of this world as it exists in a different reality. And what
    you just did is just the beginning of what it can do.\r\n"
  - 'Were you trying to pass through that gate?

'
  - "Oh, the gate? That\u2019s just a minor obstacle. My real goal lies far beyond
    it, deep within the city, locked behind riddles and barriers. I\u2019ve been
    looking for someone capable of wielding that lantern properly.\r\n"
  - "The Inner City\u2026 I was planning to go there myself. But it seems like all
    roads to it are currently blocked.\r\n"
  - "Yes, but there\u2019s an old legend. It speaks of three Obelisks scattered across
    the city, hidden in plain sight. Activate all three, and they\u2019ll open a
    path straight to the heart of the Inner City. I\u2019ve been trying to figure
    out how to reach them, but with the lantern in your hands, you might have a real
    chance.\r\n"
  - "Three Obelisks\u2026 got it. Sounds straightforward enough. I\u2019ll take care
    of it.\r\n"
  - "You\u2019re\u2026 really just agreeing to this? Just like that? No haggling
    for a reward or questioning my motives?\r\n"
  - 'Well I need to get into the Inner City anyway. If this helps us both, all the
    better.

'
  - "Aren\u2019t you a refreshing change of pace? Fine, then. Take the lantern. You\u2019ll
    need it to find the Obelisks. Once you\u2019ve activated all three, meet me at
    the gate to the Inner City. Together, we\u2019ll see what lies beyond. \nAnd\u2026
    thank you. Truly. I didn\u2019t expect to find someone so willing to help.\r\n"
