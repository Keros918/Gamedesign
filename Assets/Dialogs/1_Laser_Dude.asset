  - "Hey, that looks interesting.\r"
  - "Oh, hey there! Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d run into anyone here today. Name\u2019s
    Laser Dude - well, that\u2019s what most people call me. I\u2019m the leader
    of the Lightsaber Combat Reftreff. Normally, we hold our meetings on the campus
    grounds, but things have been getting a little\u2026dicey there lately. Makes
    it all the more important to know how to defend yourself.\r\n\r"
  - 'What do you mean by that?

'
  - "Over the past few weeks, there\u2019ve been more and more attacks on students
    by the local street gang. It\u2019s getting dangerous out there. I happen to
    have a spare lightsaber with me. If you\u2019re interested, I could show you
    a few tricks - might come in handy.\r\n"
  - "Why not? Can\u2019t hurt to learn something new.\r\n"
  - 'Well, well, what do we have here? A couple of nerds swinging glow sticks around?
    Practicing your dance moves?

'
  - "(whispers) Oh no\u2026it\u2019s the street gang.\r\n"
  - "Alright, enough of this play-acting nonsense. Hand over your wallets, and while
    you\u2019re at it, those shiny toys of yours, too. They\u2019ll fetch a nice
    price.\r\n"
  - "Look, guys, we\u2019ve got ourselves a tough one! Guess we\u2019ll just have
    to teach these nerds some manners.\r\n"
