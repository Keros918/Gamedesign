  - "Oh, hello there, sweetie! I\u2019m so sorry, but the store is currently closed
    for renovations. It\u2019s a bit of a mess in here. But don\u2019t worry - we\u2019ve
    got a couple of vending machines outside if you\u2019re just looking for a quick
    snack or drink.\r\n"
  - "Oh no, that\u2019s a shame! I just got here and was really hoping to pick up
    some groceries. But I guess the vending machines will have to do for now.\r\n"
  - "I know, it\u2019s inconvenient, isn\u2019t it? But the renovations will make
    the store much nicer, I promise! In the meantime, the vending machines should
    have a good selection of basics. Oh, and if you\u2019re buying a drink, don\u2019t
    forget that there\u2019s a deposit on the bottles and cans.\r\n"
  - 'Deposit? How does that work?

'
  - "It\u2019s pretty simple! When you buy a drink, part of the price is a refundable
    deposit. Once you\u2019re done with the bottle or can, you can return it to the
    recycling machine over there. Just pop it in, and it\u2019ll give you your deposit
    money back. It\u2019s a great system to keep things tidy and encourage recycling!\r\n"
  - "Oh, that\u2019s good to know. Thanks for explaining! I\u2019ll grab something
    and make sure to return the bottle later.\r\n"
  - "You\u2019re welcome, sweetie. Sorry again for the inconvenience. We\u2019ll
    be open again soon, so be sure to check back if you need more than just snacks.
    Take care!\r\n"
  - 'Thanks! Have a great day!
